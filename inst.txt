In this game there should be two players.

Player 1 will control their player using the WASD keys, and Player 2 should use the IJKL keys.

A player may not move to a location on the board that has a wall or another player,
but they should get 10 points any time they move to a location with a coin on it. 
In this case, the coin should disappear from the board.



You're on your own for this project, but here are some suggestions to make your work more organized:

Start by creating a fixed 5x5 board
This board should display Player 1 on the top left corner, and Player 2 on the bottom right corner
You should write some methods that, when invoked, will alter the player in that direction
